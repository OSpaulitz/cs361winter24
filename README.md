This is the repository that I will need to complete my portfolio project
Assignment 6 commit completed 2/12/24

Communication Contract:
1. How will you communicate with each other? Email for normal communications, Jira and
Asana for projects, regular Thursday check-ins.
2. Expectations for responsiveness. 24 hours for normal correspondence.
3. Collaboration: when working on deliverables for each other's projects, Aidan will work in
Jacqueline's Asana workspace and Jacqueline will work in Aidan's Jira workspace
4. Working style and deadlines: quick synchronous Thursday meeting to discuss upcoming
work.
5. Discuss potential conflicts in advance.
a. Jacqueline:
i. I will be unavailable 2/3 and 2/17 as my kids have all day tournaments.
ii. Most Fridays, I try to use that time to recenter with my family. I am happy
to meet and communicate from 9AM through 4PM. I do not work that day
and am free.
b. Aidan:
i. 2/12 is my anniversary so I will try to finish my deliverables early but be
available if needed but hoping to avoid
ii. 2/18 I will have low availability
iii. 2/24-26 and 3/1-3 I may be traveling so I will try to finish my deliverables
early; available if needed
